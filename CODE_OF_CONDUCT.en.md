## My Principles of Conduct

- I accept only honest and ethical work.
- I firmly oppose any demands that exploit or harm others.
- I respect the lessons learned by those who came before me and share what I have learned with those who come after.
- I remember that programming is both science and art, and that compassion, empathy, and understanding are more important than clever algorithms or technical debates.

- I ask for help when I am stuck.
- I respect the privacy of users.
- I remain humble and recognize that I can make mistakes.
- I act with the utmost care when matters of life and death are involved.
- I remember that I write code not for computers, but for people.
- I consider the consequences that my code and actions may cause.
- I work diligently and take pride in my work.
- I listen to others attentively and with respect, keeping an open mind.
- I regard my work not merely as labor, but as a calling, and I pursue it with sincerity and reverence.
